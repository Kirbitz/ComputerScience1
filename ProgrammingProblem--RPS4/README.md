# Programming Problem 4 from Computer Science 1
This programming problem includes the code from programming problem 3.<br/>
This one entailed the use of the Digital Downloads class in a simple<br/>
shopping program that included the option to login, list purchasable<br/>
items, search, add a book to the shopping cart, remove an item from the<br/>
shopping cart (Extra for experts), display shopping cart, checkout, and<br/>
an exit option.  Removing an item from the shopping chart was extra because<br/>
it entailed removing an item from a dynamic pointer array.
